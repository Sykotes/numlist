# numlist
A program I made to learn a bit of python which lets you do stuff with a list of numbers!

I have provided scripts to install and uninstall on linux 
Run them as root!
you might have to make install.sh and uninstall.sh executable: chmod +x install.sh
It requrires python3 

RUN ANY SCRIPTS AT YOUR OWN RISK i recommend reading them first just incase though they shouldn't break anything 


if you have any suggestions please tell me and i may even if i feel like it add them
