# numlist
A program I made to learn a bit of python which lets you do stuff with a list of numbers!

I have provided scripts to install and uninstall on linux 
Run them as root!
It requrires python3 

RUN ANY SCRIPTS AT YOUR OWN RISK i recommend reading them first just incase though they shouldn't break anything
